This is My first Spring Boot Project. I created various REST API for show  or modify the Student Profile.

# Student Management System - CRUD Application

## Description

This is a Spring Boot application that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing students. The project demonstrates the use of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and an H2/other database for managing student records.

## Features

- Create a new student record
- Read (view) all students or a specific student by ID
- Update an existing student record
- Delete a student record
- RESTful APIs for all CRUD operations

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the database
- **H2 Database** (or MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.): In-memory database for testing (you can replace it with other databases)
- **Maven**: Dependency management
- **Postman** (optional): For API testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven
- IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode)
- Postman (optional, for API testing)

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the H2 Database Console (if using H2)**
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
   - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
   - Username: `sa`
   - Password: (leave it empty)

5. **Test the REST APIs using Postman or any other REST client**

### API Endpoints

Here are the main endpoints of the application:

- **GET /students**: Retrieve all students
- **GET /students/{id}**: Retrieve a student by ID
- **POST /students**: Add a new student
- **PUT /students/{id}**: Update an existing student by ID
- **DELETE /students/{id}**: Delete a student by ID

### Example Requests

- **POST /students**
   ```json
   {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
       "course": "Computer Science"
   }
   ```

- **PUT /students/1**
   ```json
   {
       "name": "Jane Doe",
       "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
       "course": "Mathematics"
   }
   ```
